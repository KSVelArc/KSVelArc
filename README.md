ABOUT ME
- 👋 I have a Ph.D. in Biology. I use computational methods to study human genetic variation.
- 👀 Topics include: human evolution, population genetics, ancient DNA, archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans), archaic introgression.
- 🌱 Other interests include:
  -  Geology 🗻. Everywhere I go, I review the geology of the place and collect rocks.
  -  Speculative fiction literature 📚. My favorite authors are Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov. I have a collection of old Sci-Fi magazine issues including "Galaxy Science Fiction", "Worlds of if Science Fiction", and "Fantasy and Science Fiction". I am also interested in Absurdist fiction (e.g. Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre).
